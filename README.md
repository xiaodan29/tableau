# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
### - WITH OVER 30,000 LISTINGS IN NEW YORK CITY, TRY TO INVESTIGATE THE DATA FROM 2008 - 2015

### - TRY TO FIND ANY PATTERN OR TREND FOR THIS CITY 


## Process
### 
- Using python first to do the data cleaning 
### 
- Trying to understand each columnâ€™s meaning and representing
###
 - Deleting null value and other data analysis
###
 - Using Tableau to do the visualazations


## Results
 - I chose the option 2 - Airbnb
 - I found the price has been increased year by year, but the ratings have been decreased over the years
 - The most expensive neigbourhood is in Manhattan but it doesn't mean the avg price can be lower than other neigbourhoods. 
 - People are tending to choose the most cost-efficient rooms not the highest rating ones

## Challenges 
- Not quite familiar with the function and features of tableau, still need to be master of it in the future

## Future Goals
- Get more detailed and deeper across all the data to do the analysis more logical and meaningful
